## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Junior persuing BTech in Computer Science. I like to explore new opportunities around me to learn about upcoming technologies. I am skilled in data structures and algorithms and like to solve many problems on them. I am constantly involved in competitive coding with Java/C++.

Being in a constant state of responsibility is my idea of growth. I always look forward to undertaking responsibilities and lead a team of ambitious people to achieve and innovate newer dimensions!

I am a highly ambitious and competent MERN stack web-developer and freelance web-developer. I have proficiency in HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, JavaScript, NodeJs, MongoDB and ReactJs.

### I firmly standby, believe and apply the three principles, i.e., VIQ (Value, Innovation, Quality) in every project that i undertake. 

  - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a clone of VsCode, with electron.
